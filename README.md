## About

This little app's purpose is basically to show off some UI (auth form) and then also introduce myself. The source code for this app is public. The resulting site is statically generated and deployed to GitHub pages.

The sign-in form in the app is for demo purposes only. The visitor can appreciate the attention to detail, accessibility, and smooth animations.

**Please use any name that you prefer, and the password is optional.**

The form doesn't store or in any way process the provided data. It mocks the request to the server to make it feel more like an actual authorization flow.

After the form is submitted it takes the viewer to a minimalistic profile page, where I introduce myself, list my core values and interests, and provide some links.

If you like what you see, feel free to reach out, even if just to say hi! ðŸ‘‹
